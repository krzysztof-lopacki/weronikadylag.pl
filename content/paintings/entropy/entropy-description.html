<h3>acrylic on linen canvas, 150x100cm (47"x39")</h3>
<p>Entropy is an acrylic painting on a linen canvas, coated with an anti-UV varnish. Signed at the back. Comes with certificate of authenticity. Entropy is part of "Journey"/"In chaos we prevail" cycle. Inspired by the work of Chang Che that I discovered via Galerie Vazieux and the book "Chaotic harmony". The colour plaette was chaged for this cycle specificly. The work was created with fluid paint moved and spread across the canvas with strong blows of air.</p>
