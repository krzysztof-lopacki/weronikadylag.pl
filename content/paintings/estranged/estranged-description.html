<h1 class="massive">Estranged</h1>
<h3>acrylic on raw linen canvas, 100x170cm (39"x67")</h3>
<p>Estranged is an acrylic painting on raw linen 3D canvas. This is the fifth painting in the "From Darkness to Light" series. Like Suvienage, it was inspired by the work of Change Che.</p>
<p>It is a painting dedicated to the darkness of alienation - the overwhelming feeling of loneliness and mourning after the loss of a close relationship. They consist of a gradual erosion of a once intimate and cherished bond and a systematic distancing from each other. It takes dedication and courage to rekindle a relationship and forge a new relationship. Unfortunately, many relationships wither and die, never to be rekindled.</p>
