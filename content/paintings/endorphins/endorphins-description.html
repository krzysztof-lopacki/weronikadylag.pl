<h1 class="massive">Endorphins</h1>
<h3>acrylic paint on canvas, 100x150cm (39"x59")</h3>
<p>Endorphins are an endogenous opioid neuropeptide.
    It is a peptide hormone humans and other animals produce.
    It is created in pituitary gland and is responsible for
    reducing stress and pain relief. But the by-product of this
    hormone at work is the feeling of euphoria. Endorphins are
    being released when in pain as a pain-killers but also they
    are produced when we are working out, being physically
    active, when we engage in sexual activities or when we eat
    for eg. chocolate. Endorphins just like other
    hormones/neurotransmitters are very important for our
    mental health. We need them but we also like them. This
    painting is a representation of endorphins at work. The
    explosion of bright colours is supposed to be uplifting,
    creating an unexplained feeling of lightness and freshness</p>
