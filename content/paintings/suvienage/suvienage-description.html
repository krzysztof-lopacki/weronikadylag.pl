<p>Sometimes we are so focused on our day to day tasks, we are forgetting that we are more than our work, more than our societal roles.</p>
<p>Suvinage, the inaugural piece of my new opus, "Journey". This neologism, Suvinage, a construct of my own imagination, has yet to find a place in any vernacular. It is an emblem of my singular mind, much like the painting itself, which was inspired by the visual journey of Chuang Che's oeuvre.</p>
<p>This term encapsulates the essence of a transformative odyssey, one that requires courage, self-exploration, and personal development. It is an ode to the human spirit's innate desire to embark on a journey of self-discovery and growth. Suvinage invites the viewer to join me on this expedition, to embrace the unknown, and to discover what lies beyond the horizon.</p>
