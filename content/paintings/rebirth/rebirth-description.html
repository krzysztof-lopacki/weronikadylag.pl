<h3>acrylic on raw linen canvas, 100x200cm (39"x78")</h3>
<p>"Rebirth" is a two-panel artwork made with acrylic paint on raw linen canvases, coated with anti-UV varnish. It draws inspiration from the abstract paintings of Chinese artist Chuang Che, who currently resides in New York, as well as the spring season, which is reflected in the choice of color palette. The painting technique involves using fluid paint spread with strong gusts of air and brushes. The panels are signed on the back and come with a certificate of authenticity.</p>
