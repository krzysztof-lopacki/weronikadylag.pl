<h1 class="massive">Attentive</h1>
<h3>acrylic on canvas, 100x120cm (39"x47")</h3>
<p>
  "Paying close attention to something" - Are you? Are
  you really paying attention to: what you see? What do
  you hear? to your kids? to your partner? to your own
  feelings? to your body? to your emotions? Do you really
  pay attention?
</p>
<p>
  Attentive is a painting-reminder and like seeking it is a
  psychological exercise - a mindfulness training of
  paying attention. The painting was created in many
  sessions, layer by layer. In it's form it alludes to organic
  forms and was a part of "Not obvious forms" solo
  exhibition at Museum of Krajenska Land.
