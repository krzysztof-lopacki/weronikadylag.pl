<h1 class="massive">Seeking</h1>
<h3>acrylic on canvas, 140x100cm (55"x39")</h3>
<p>
  We are seeking for many things in life - attention, love, 
  acceptance for starters. We seek new experiences, 
  new tastes, new fragrances. It is imprinted into a 
  human nature as it is a natural consequence of our 
  curiosity, needs, desires. "Skeeking" is a painting about 
  our needs and desires within this particular moment. It 
  is painting that is ment to be a psychological excercie, 
  a mindfulness traning to ask ourselves - What am I 
  seeking?
