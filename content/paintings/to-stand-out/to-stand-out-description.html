<h1 class="massive">To stand out</h1>
<h3>acrylic on canvas, 100x120cm (39"x47")</h3>
<p>
  Do you like to stand out? I nver liked it. I hated it. But what it means to stand out? Now I just think it
  is just simply allowing yourself to be yourself. To let go of the expectations your parents had, you have
  now, others have. It is simply to be.
