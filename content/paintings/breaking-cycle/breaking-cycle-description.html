<p>Cycles are a natural part of our everydaylife. From the seasons to choosing our life partners - it is
  happening in some kind of a pattern. Some patterns are having minor effect on our lives while others tend
  to have a massive and destructive effects, yet we hold on to them. Breaking cycle is an invitation to
  change. To break free.</p>
