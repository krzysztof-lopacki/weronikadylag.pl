  Self awareness - what is it? When do we say that somebody is aware of self? If I have unconcius motives
  for my behavior that I am not aware of can I say I am self aware? Is simply noticing things that are
  happening to us enough to say that we are self-aware? Does simply feeling makes us self-aware? Dubito ergo
  cogit, cogito ergo sum - was Descartes right? Dubito?
