<h1 class="massive">Self awareness</h1>
<h3>acrylic on canvas, 100x100cm (39"x39")</h3>
<p>
  The work was inspired by works of Ismael Lagares
  exhibited by Lanford Gallery. It is a part of the 
  "exploring red" cycle - same as "Inner self". The painting 
  was done in many sessions to make sure that the layer 
  underneath was dry just before adding another one. 
  Self-awareness is our acknowledgment of existence. It 
  is what helps us to observe our behaviour and 
  emotions and experience the world and adapt to it. 
  Our understanding of what self-awareness is - is little. 
  But we do know when it exists.
