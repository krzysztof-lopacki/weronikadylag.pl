                            in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full
                            involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.</p>

                            Self just like awareness is one of the terms we just accepted but never been able to determin and describe
                            properly. Who we are inside, who/what dives us, who exactly has desires is a matter of study. What part of
