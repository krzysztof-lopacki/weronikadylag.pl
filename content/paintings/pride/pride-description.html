  &quot;Pride is usually a positive emotion or affect that is the result of an individual’s autonomous
  personal evaluation of their own behavior, actions, possessions, relationships, affiliations, self, or
  identity which accords with shared societal and cultural values. Sometimes equivocated with high
  self-esteem or increased status in the actual or imagined “eyes of others,” pride is a complex emotion.
  Research on individual pride has been limited to paradigmatic situations (e.g., achievement in competitive
  sporting or academic situations) and has tended to ignore the multiple contexts in which it is a
  personally, socially, politically, and culturally significant emotion. Contrary to a popular perspective
  of pride as one emotion with both negative and positive forms – designated authentic and hubristic (Tracy
  &amp; Robins, 2004) – it is regarded in this entry as a positive experience of agency, achievement, or
  identification that may be inappropriately felt and expressed. &quot; Gavin Sullivan
