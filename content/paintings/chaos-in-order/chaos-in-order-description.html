<h1 class="massive">Chaos in order</h1>
<h3>acrylic on linen canvas 3D, 170x100cm (67"x39")</h3>
<p>The piece is an integral part of the latest series, "In Chaos We Prevail," which draws inspiration from the artistic endeavors of Chuang Che, a Chinese artist residing in New York. Che adeptly merges American abstract expressionism with traditional Chinese art, and this fusion serves as a catalyst for my own artistic exploration. Fascinated by the concept of "Chaotic Harmony," which I encountered at Galerie Vazieux, I felt compelled to shift my color palette and venture into uncharted territory with regards to forms and compositions.</p>
<p>The artwork has been carefully varnished with an anti-UV coating and will be accompanied by a certificate of authenticity.</p>
