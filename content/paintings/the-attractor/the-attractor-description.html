<h3>acrylic on linen canvas 3D, 170x100cm (67"x39")</h3>
<p>The Attractor is an acrylic painting coated with anti-UV varnish, skillfully crafted using fluid paint and powerful bursts of air. It comes with a certificate of authenticity signed by the artist. This artwork is part of a new series inspired by Chuang Che, a Chinese artist residing and working in New York.</p>
<p>Drawing from the concept of attractors in chaos theory, The Attractor represents a collection of states found within the mathematical realm of dynamical systems that a system naturally tends to gravitate towards over time. In moments of imbalance, the system instinctively seeks out the nearest attractor. Personally, I have artistically interpreted these attractors and incorporated them into my creative process, accentuating their impact on movement.</p>
