<h3>acrylic paint on raw linen canvas, 80x60cm (31"x23")</h3>
<p>Every one of us has a personality characteristic that meets three criteria: it must be consistent, stable, and it varies from person to person. Modern psychology thinks of five
    dimensions of personality traits: Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Neuroticism, Openness. Each is a spectrum that we can score differently in different stages of
    life. Individual traits i s a part of an ongoing series "Mindfulness exercises" and is asking us to review what dimensions of our personality we would like to work on and
    develop now.</p>
