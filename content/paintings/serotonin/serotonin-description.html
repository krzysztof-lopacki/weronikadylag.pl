<h1 class="massive">Serotonin</h1>
<h3>acyrlic on canvas, 80x60cm (31"x23")</h3>
<p>
    Serotonin is a part of series I created about
    neurotransmiters. Serotonin is a hormone we all need
    to regulate our behavior - mood, cognition, reward
    (alon with dopamine), learning, memory, and
    numerous physiological processes such as vomiting
    and vasoconstriction. Low levels of serotonin are
    thought to play a role in depression, anxiety, mania
    and other mental health conditions. The painting is
    created on a raw linen canvases with the use of acrylic
    paint. Like all my paintings it was created with out the
    use of brush - with strong blows of air instead.
