<h1 class="massive">Inner self</h1>
<h3>acrylic on canvas, 100x100cm (39"x39")</h3>
<p>
  The work was inspired by the work of Ismael Lagares
  that was exhibited in Lanford Gallery. I have never 
  thought about using red before. It never spoke to me -
  it seemed too aggressive and too loud. I never wanted 
  to stand out and red is a colour that makes you pop 
  out so it was natural for me to avoid it. But Ismael 
  Lagares' work showed me that red can be also joyful, 
  playful if you like.So I started exploring and "Inner self" 
  is one of the revelations I had about red and about 
  myself - it's ok to stand out. As Paul Klein once said: "Be 
  distinctive"</p>
