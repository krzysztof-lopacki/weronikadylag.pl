  women who started working with fluid oil paint. Her works intrigued with a watercolour-like touch. <a

    White Square”</a> I think is my favourite work of hers. It’s vivid and delicate at the same time. But
  many of her works were delicate precisely because she was using fluid paint. She had to dilute the paint
  in order to be able to work with fluid paint. Today we can work with different mediums that can help to
  liquefy the paint without thinning it and loosing pigment.</p>
