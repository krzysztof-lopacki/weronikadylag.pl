<h1 class="semi-massive">The purpose of art</h1>
<p>
    We recently took a short trip to Sicily. Among eating italian food, walking around the cities and getting
    way up to see Etna up close, we were sightseeing.</p>
<p>
    Our first stop was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Romana_del_Casale">the Villa Romana del Casale</a>.
    Beautiful place and a great opportunity to see mosaic floors. Rooms designeted for work and
    for servants had decorative patterns. Those designeted for the family were created to tell stories...
