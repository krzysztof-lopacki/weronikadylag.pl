<p>On 11th of January the Krajenska Land Museum’s Director Mr. Tomasz Pasieka and me opened my first museum
    solo show. It was great to see that I was not the only one to be so excited about the exhibition – the
    museum’s director was too. It was a museum that helped me to take my first steps torwards art. It is a
    place where I started drawing, I discovered pastels and a place I had my first contact with oil paint.</p>
