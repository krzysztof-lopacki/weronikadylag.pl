<h1 class="semi-massive">Colour palette</h1>
<p>Although perception of colour seems like it is objective, 
    just like choosing colours it is a subjective and emotional act but it might be rational too. 
    My palette is both emotional and rational choice dictated by association of positive emotions with brightness.</p>
